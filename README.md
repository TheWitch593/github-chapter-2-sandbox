# 🌟 Git & Teams - Codédex Exercise 09 🌟

Welcome to my project workspace! 👩‍💻✨

This repository is part of my **Codédex Git & GitHub course**, specifically for **Exercise 09: Git & Teams**. Here, I’m learning how to collaborate with others using Git — like pulling the latest changes, committing responsibly, and staying in sync with my team! 🧠💡

## 🧪 Scenario

Imagine this:
> I'm working on a feature branch, and my teammate pushes changes that fix a bug I was stuck on. Instead of redoing everything, I simply run:
git pull
...and voilà! I have the latest updates and can continue without conflict. 💫

## 💾 What this repo contains

- A practice README file (this one!)
- Commit history demonstrating:
  - Adding a new file
  - Pulling updates from the main branch
  - Simulating real-world team collaboration workflows

## 🛠 Commands Practiced

- `git checkout branch-name` 🧭
- `git pull` 🔄
- `git commit -m "message"` ✍️
- `git push` 🚀

🧡 Thanks, Codédex, for making Git fun to learn!  
Happy coding! 🌈
